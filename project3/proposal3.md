Are Americans Happy?

Given that Americans have higher incomes and experience a better quality of life than most other nationalities, are Americans happy or unhappy?

I am planning to use the GSS dataset that we've been using throughout the semester to tackle this question. Some ethical concerns that arise when using the GSS data includes privacy concerns, in terms of protecting the identity and integrity of those surveyed, promote misinformation by selecting specific data to support a particular claim while disregarding things that may contradict that claim, and making false implications based on my results.
