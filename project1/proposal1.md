Opioid Overdose Deaths: 15 years of opioid overdose deaths
data.world
 
I have CSV files that contain the data but I?m still looking for other datasets that might have more variables that may present a better picture of this epidemic. The current data sets focus on death by overdose. One concern that I can think about is extrapolating without statistical evidence and significance which can spread misinformation and defile the characters of those reported in the data, I?m not quite sure. But I would rather not continue spreading misconceptions about opioid drug victims.

4) Which part of the country is severely affected by this data?
The rate at which these deaths have increased/decreased based on regional grouping?
Who is mostly impacted (race, education, age, income, suburb/rural/inner city, medical history, etc)?
In the process, I want to provide some of the factors that lead to these deaths and why specifically those regions if there?s a trend?
There?s more to ask but these are some of my thoughts regarding the topic.
