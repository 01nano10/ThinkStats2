<body>
Alcohol abuse is a disease that affects millions in the US. Similarly, opiods have become a national healh crisis signaling a substantial increase in opiods use in the US. This project attempts at signaling the difference and reports the relationship between the consumption of alcohol in the US and the consumption of heroin (a commonly used/abused opioid) in the US for the year 2017. Under the hypothesis that alcohol consumption can predict the consumption of heroin, there seems to be a weak, negative, linear relationship between the two variables under question, with correlation coefficient of -0.22.
