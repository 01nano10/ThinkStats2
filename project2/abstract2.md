Time Series is a sequence of observations taken at discrete intervals in time. They are worth investigated due to the powerful insights they provide in forecasting and predicting future observations. Time series analysis has been one of many tools used to analyze stocks. I utilize statsmodels to show how to perform a time series analysis in python using the S&P 500 Index closing prices. Over a 20 year period, I show how to test for stationarity, estimate parameters for the ARIMA model to forecast the 2018 monthly returns of the S&P 500 Index. This analysis provides a first step at performing a time series analysis and building the intuition to interpret the results.
