## A Time Series Analysis of the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index
#### Daphka Alius
I am planning to work with the monthly adjusted closing prices of the S&P500 over a 20 years period(1997-2017). The data was retrieved from Yahoo Finance. I hope to extract useful information in order to forecast the returns for the year 2018. In addition, I will compare it with the actual results to see whether the model was the best fit. Through this process, I would like to understand the purpose and methodologies of time series analysis in Python. Some limitations of this process is that a model does not guarantee with full certainty the predicted values. With that said, an ethical concern that may arise from my results would be to misrepresent the data and forecast as a valid method to vet and invest in stocks based on the procedures of this project.
