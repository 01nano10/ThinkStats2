# The Virtue if the God-fearing Man
###### By: Jordan Crawford-O'Banner

Religion is tied deeply into the foundations of human society. From it, we have derived morals, ideologies and entire schools of thought. More often than not, religion is tied to the idea of being a good or moral person. The belief is that if you are a God-fearing person and you follow all of the guidelines set out by your belief system you will be rewarded because you have been a good person. Considering the wide number of religions and ideologies in the world, there is a question of whether or not being a more religious person actually makes you a more moral person. However, it would be irresponsible to presume that I can define whether or not a person's belief or actions make them more moral than another. I will therefore be using moral foundation theory to define what a religious person values most and see how a person who is less religious aligns with those vales.

We will try to predict the moral values of a religious person by using data from the General Social Survey to correlate a persons views on various issues with how religious they are. We will estimate how religious a person is by how often they attend religious meetings and how fundamentalist they consider their religion. Each of the issues will be categorized according to which of the values within moral foundation theory they appeal to. Moral foundation theory states that all of human moral reasoning stems from six innate, modular foundations.

- Liberty: the power or scope to act as one pleases; opposite of oppression
- Purity: abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of degradation
- Fairness: rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of cheating
- Care: cherishing and protecting others; opposite of harm
- Loyalty: standing with your group, family, nation; opposite of betrayal
- Authority: submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of subversion

Everyone cares about all of these values, but different groups and individuals may value certain foundations more than others. We would assume that people who are more religious would value purity, loyalty and authority than people who do not have a religion or do not participate in religious activities very often. People who are less religious would therefore value liberty, fairness and care more.

Below there is a histogram of the number of respondents within different religions.
